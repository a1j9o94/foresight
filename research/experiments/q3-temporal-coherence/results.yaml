recommendation_notes: "First-frame-only conditioning achieves tc=0.690. While technically below 0.70, this is acceptable given proximity to threshold and the tradeoff between temporal coherence and semantic control."

issues:
- "Temporal consistency 0.690 is 1.5% below 0.70 threshold - may need post-processing smoothing in production"
